# boardgame-ai-agent
An AI agent designed for a simple boardgame for a school project
\n
Working with another person, this project was for an AI course at McGill.
\n
Our work is primarily done in agents/student_agent.py, and you can read our report in /report.
\n
If you would like to quickly see the agent in action, run `python simulator.py --player_1 random_agent --player_2 student_agent --display`.
\n
For game rules and more advanced modes of running, see the readme provided by McGill, under READMESCHOOL.md
